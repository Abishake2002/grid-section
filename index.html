            <h5>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h5>
            <p class="p">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed same structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during Interviews as an example of my developent experience it certainly. helped me land a job as a full-stack. developer after receiving multiple offers 100% recommend!"</p>
